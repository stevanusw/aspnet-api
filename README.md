# aspnet-api

This was a self-initiative and ongoing project developed with ASP.NET 6/7/8 Web API. The
purpose of the project is to keep myself updated with the quick evolution of modern
frameworks such as ASP.NET. The API hosts various features such as structured logging,
versioning, data shaping and HATEOAS.
